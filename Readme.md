libovr-rs
=========

This project is WIP and totally broken at the moment.
For a working wrapper of the Oculus Rift SDK for Rust check out [vr-rs](https://github.com/csherratt/vr-rs).
My goal here is to port the bindings to SDK 0.4.3.
But since I'm totally new to Rust, don't expect this to work anytime soon...
